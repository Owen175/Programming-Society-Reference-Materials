No.1 tip:
USE GOOGLE. If you are struggling with anything, someone has stack overflowed it.

Datatypes:
string: (str()): several alphanumeric characters such as '1fasdjh2395'. They are JUST symbols - you cannot add '1' and '2'.
integer: (int()): any number WITHOUT a decimal place
float: (float()): any number WITH a decimal place. Short for floating point.
boolean: either True or False: need the capital letter
list (array): (arr()): a list of several items.
There are more, but you will probably not need them.
